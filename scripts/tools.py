def resolve_library_id(
    libraryName: str
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns a list of matching libraries.

You MUST call this function before 'get-library-docs' to obtain a valid Context7-compatible library ID UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their query.

Selection Process:
1. Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for
2. Return the most relevant match based on:
- Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized)
- Description relevance to the query's intent
- Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts)
- Source reputation (consider libraries with High or Medium reputation more authoritative)
- Benchmark Score: Quality indicator (100 is the highest score)

Response Format:
- Return the selected library ID in a clearly marked section
- Provide a brief explanation for why this library was chosen
- If multiple good matches exist, acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant one
- If no good matches exist, clearly state this and suggest query refinements

For ambiguous queries, request clarification before proceeding with a best-guess match.

    Fetches up-to-date documentation for a library.
